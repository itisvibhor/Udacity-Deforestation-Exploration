 Report for ForestQuery into Global
Deforestation, 1990 to 2016
ForestQuery is on a mission to combat deforestation around the world and to raise awareness about this topic and its impact on the environment. The data analysis team at ForestQuery has obtained data from the World Bank that includes forest area and total land area by country and year from 1990 to 2016, as well as a table of countries and the regions to which they belong.
The data analysis team has used SQL to bring these tables together and to query them in an effort to find areas of concern as well as areas that present an opportunity to learn from successes.
1. GLOBAL SITUATION
According to the World Bank, the total forest area of the world was 41282694.9 km/sq in 1990. As of 2016, the most recent year for which data was available, that number had fallen to 39958245.9 km/sq, a loss of 1324449 km/sq, or 3.20%.
The forest area lost over this time period is slightly more than the entire land area of Peru listed for the year 2016 (which is 1279999.9891).
2. REGIONAL OUTLOOK
In 2016, the percent of the total land area of the world designated as forest was 31.37% . The region with the highest relative forestation was   , with 46.16 %, and the region with the lowest relative forestation was   , with 2.06 % forestation.
In 1990, the percent of the total land area of the world designated as forest was 32.42%. The region with the highest relative forestation was   , with 51.03%, and the region with the lowest relative forestation was   , with 1.77 % forestation.

         The only regions of the world that decreased in percent forest area from 1990 to 2016 were Latin America & Caribbean (dropped from 51.03% to 46.16%) and Sub-Saharan Africa (30.65% to 28.72%). All other regions actually increased in forest area over this time period. However, the drop in forest area in the two aforementioned regions was so large, the percent forest area of the world decreased over this time period from 32.42% to 31.37%.
3. COUNTRY-LEVEL DETAIL A. SUCCESS STORIES
There is one particularly bright spot in the data at the country level, China. This country actually increased in forest area from 1990 to 2016 by 527229.062 km/sq. It would be interesting to study what has changed in this country over this time to drive this figure in the data higher. The country with the next largest increase in forest area from 1990 to 2016 was the United States, but it only saw an increase of 79200 km/sq, much lower than the figure for China.
Russian Federation and China are of course very large countries in total land area, so when we look at the largest percent change in forest area from 1990 to 2016, we aren’t surprised to find a much smaller country listed at the top.Iceland increased in forest area by 213.66 % from 1990 to 2016.
        
 B. LARGEST CONCERNS
Which countries are seeing deforestation to the largest degree? We can answer this question in two ways. First, we can look at the absolute square kilometer decrease in forest area from 1990 to 2016. The following 3 countries had the largest decrease in forest area over the time period under consideration:
Table 3.1: Top 5 Amount Decrease in Forest Area by Country, 1990 & 2016:
     Country
Region
Absolute Forest Area Change
Brazil
Latin America & Caribbean
 541510
 Indonesia
 East Asia & Pacific
 282193.98
 Myanmar
 East Asia & Pacific
 107234.00
 Nigeria
 Sub-Saharan Africa
 106506.00
 Tanzania
 Sub-Saharan Africa
 102320
       The second way to consider which countries are of concern is to analyze the data by percent decrease.
Table 3.2: Top 5 Percent Decrease in Forest Area by Country, 1990 & 2016:
     Country
Region
Pct Forest Area Change
Togo
Sub-Saharan Africa
 75.45
Nigeria
 Sub-Saharan Africa
 61.80
Uganda
 Sub-Saharan Africa
 59.27
Mauritania
 Sub-Saharan Africa
 46.75
Honduras
 Latin America & Caribbean
 45.03
      When we consider countries that decreased in forest area percentage the most between 1990 and 2016, we find that four of the top 5 countries on the list are in the region of Sub-Saharan Africa. The countries are Togo,     , and . The 5th country on the list is Honduras, which is in the   region.
 Nigeria,
Uganda
Mauritania
 Latin America & Caribbean
 
 From the above analysis, we see that Nigeria is the only country that ranks in the top 5 both in terms of absolute square kilometer decrease in forest as well as percent decrease in forest area from 1990 to 2016. Therefore, this country has a significant opportunity ahead to stop the decline and hopefully spearhead remedial efforts.

     The largest number of countries in 2016 were found in the 1st quartile.
There were 3 countries in the top quartile in 2016. These are countries with a very high percentage of their land area designated as forest. The following is a list of countries and their respective forest land, denoted as a percentage.

    4. RECOMMENDATIONS
Write out a set of recommendations as an analyst on the ForestQuery team.

 ● What have you learned from the World Bank data?
● Which countries should we focus on over others?
The things i have learned from the World Bank Data is that over the due course of time there are many countries that have an increase in the forest area inspite of increase in population of the world as a whole. Its interesting to see that India and China has increase in Forest area though the population is also increasing keeping the land area limited.There are alot of regions which includes many countries that have a decrease in forest area from 1990 to 2016.
The countries we should focus are mainly Brazil , Indonesia , Myanmar , Nigeria and Tanzania as they have a alot of forest land in 1990 but in 2016 it has dropped alot.Its a major concern for these countries as the more forest area they have it will lead to a better conditions and more balanced habitat for human beings as well as plants and animals due to which global concerns like global warming and other green house gases effects will be less making survival possible.
